# _freeCodeCamp Tribute Page Project_

A tribute page to **Quokka's** arguably the happiest animal in the world

There were **9** requirements for the project, the detailed list can be seen [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).

The _freeCodeCamp HTML_ and _CSS_ video was a really good starting point for this project.

I really enjoyed completing this task and it's helped emphasise the importance of things such as _syntax_ and _breaking tasks down_.
