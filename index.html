            <h3 id="headline">Here's some interesting facts about Quokkas</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Their scientific name is <strong>SETONIX BRACHYURUS</strong></li>
                <li>
                    The primary home for Quokkas is on Rottnest Island however small
                    groups also inhabit mainland WA as well as Bald Island, Australia
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quokkas were first discovered in 1696 by Willem de Vlamingh who
                    mistakenly though they were giant rats. He named the island
                    "Ratten-nest"
                </li>
                <li>
                    They are part of the kangaroo family and move around by hopping
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quokkas can survive a long time without food and water by storing
                    fat in their tails
                </li>
                <li>
                    They weigh between 2.5 to 5 kilograms, and are rougly the same of a
                    small cat
                </li>
                <li>In the wild they can live up to 15 years</li>
                <li>
                    Baby quokkas are called 'joeys' and when born, they ride in their
                    mother's pouch for about six months
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the mainland, quokkas can breed all year around but on Rottnest
                    Island breeding season is from January to August
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is estimated that there are between 7,500-15,000 mature adults in
                    the wild
                </li>
            </ol>
